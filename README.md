# Bookbot
BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project! It originally only had Frankenstein hardcoded, but I decided it might be fun to expand its capabilities for fun. So now it can run a little 'book report' on any *.txt doc you throw at it.

## Usage
1. Create a books/ directory in the root and then throw any `*.txt` files in there you want
1. Run the script with `python3 main.py`
1. Enter the index of the doc you want a report on
1. Boom, done, enjoy!
